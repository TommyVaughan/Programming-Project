#### Fisher’s Iris Data Set

The [Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) or Fisher’s Iris data set is a [multiverse data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics) introduced by the British statistician and biologist [Ronald Fisher](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ronald_Fisher) in his 1936 paper *“The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”*.
The data set consists of the measurements of four attributes of 150 iris flowers from three types of irises. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimetres. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed.
