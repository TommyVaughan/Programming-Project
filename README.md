#### Fisher’s Iris Data Set

The Iris data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is a multiverse data* set introduced by the British statistician and biologist [Ronald Fisher](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ronald_Fisher) in his 1936 paper “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”.
*Multiverse data is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable. It concerns understanding the different aims and background of each of the different forms of multivariate analysis, and how they relate to each other.
The data set consists of the measurements of four attributes of 150 iris flowers from three types of irises. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimetres. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed.
